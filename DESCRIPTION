Description: Computation of effects under linear, logistic and Poisson regression
    models with transformed variables. Logarithm and power transformations are allowed.
    Effects can be displayed both numerically and graphically in both the original
    and the transformed space of the variables. The methods are described in Barrera-Gomez
    and Basagana (2015) <doi:10.1097/EDE.0000000000000247>.
